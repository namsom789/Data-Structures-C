## Overview

Welcome to the **Data-Structures-C** repository! This repository focuses on implementing essential data structures in the C programming language. C programming is known for its robust features such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and an extensive standard library. By exploring this repository, you will delve into fundamental data structures like stacks (Last In, First Out), queues (First In, First Out), linked lists (singly, doubly, circular), and collision handling techniques in hashing (chaining, open addressing).
